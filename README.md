# MoodleUpdater

**MoodleUpdater** is a script designed to automate the process of updating a Moodle instance. It supports directory and database backups, cloning the Moodle repository, and restoring configuration files. With multithreading, the script can efficiently handle multiple tasks simultaneously.

## Features

- **Configuration Management**:
  - Centralized configuration using a `config.ini` file.
  - Easily specify repository URL, branch, Moodle path, and folder name.

- **Backup Functionality**:
  - Perform a full or partial backup of your Moodle directory.
  - Backup the Moodle database using `mysqldump`.

- **Git Integration**:
  - Clone Moodle's repository from GitHub.
  - Checkout specific branches and sync submodules.
  - Before updating Moodle, MoodleUpdater now compares the local Moodle version with the latest version available in the configured Git repository. This ensures that updates are not performed if not possible, preventing unnecessary downtime.

- **Automation**:
  - Multithreaded execution for combined tasks.
  - Prompts to confirm actions with optional default responses.
  - Automatically restart Apache or Nginx after updates and Moodle CLI upgrades.
  - Optionally perform a Moodle CLI upgrade via `admin/cli/upgrade.php`, now with pre-upgrade and post-upgrade system checks.
  - The script runs `admin/cli/checks.php` before and after the upgrade to detect potential issues.
  - Optionally enable Moodle Maintenance Mode during Moodle CLI upgrade.
  - Optionally restart the database service before a database dump.

- **User and Group Ownership**:
  - Optionally set the user and group ownership for Moodle files and directories after cloning or updating Moodle.
  - Configure the ownership settings through the `chown_user` and `chown_group` options in `config.ini` to ensure proper file permissions (e.g., `www-data`).

- **User-Friendly**:
  - Guided prompts for paths, database credentials, and other configurations.
  - Default values and skip options for most steps.

- **Update MoodleUpdater with Git Pull**:
  - Optionally pull the latest version of the script from the Git repository on start.
  - Configurable through the `auto_update_script` setting in `config.ini`. When enabled, the script automatically checks for updates and pulls them if no local changes are detected.
  - If `auto_update_script` is disabled, user is asked if he wants to pull MoodleUpdater from GitHub.
  - Compares `config.ini` with `config_template.ini` and highlights any differences to ensure proper configuration.
  - Retrieve and display detailed information about the current commit (time, author, summary).
  - Automatically checks and reports the branch name, current commit details, and updated commit details after pulling changes.
  - After successfully pulling updates from the Git repository, the script automatically restarts itself. This ensures that the latest changes take effect immediately, eliminating the need for manual restarts.

- **Progress and Memory Monitoring**:
  - During a database dump, the script actively monitors the dump file progress and system memory usage in real-time. One monitoring thread checks if the dump file is increasing in size (and warns if progress stalls), while another thread tracks available and free memory. This dual monitoring ensures that any potential stalls or memory issues are detected early, helping to maintain system stability during the update process.

- **Enhanced Logging**: 
  - Configurable logging with options for console and file output.
  - Supports log rotation and adjustable logging levels for better debugging and monitoring.
  - The script measures and logs the execution time for key operationsâ€”directory backup, database dump, and Git clone. It also records the total runtime and calculates the time saved through multithreading when multiple tasks run concurrently. These detailed statistics provide valuable insights into the performance and efficiency of the update process.

## Requirements

- **Operating System**: Linux-based (e.g., Ubuntu)
- **Dependencies**:
  - `python3`
  - `rsync`
  - `mysql-client` (MySQL or MariaDB tools)
  - `git`
  - Root or sudo permissions for system and database operations.
- **Additional Dependency**:
    In addition to the main dependencies, the script requires the `python3-apt` package for managing the apt cache. It also relies on system utilities such as the `free` command, which is standard on Linux systems.
    The script can detect installed webserver and database services and optionally restart them. This requires `systemctl` for managing services.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ramhee98/MoodleUpdater.git
   cd MoodleUpdater
   ```

2. Ensure required dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3 rsync mysql-client git
   ```

3. Set up the configuration file:

   The `config.ini` file contains the following settings:
   - **dry_run**: Enable dry run mode to simulate operations without making any changes.
   - **auto_update_script**: Automatically check and pull updates for MoodleUpdater from the Git repository at the start. Default is True.
   - **repo**: URL of the Moodle repository to clone.
   - **branch**: Branch of the Moodle repository to checkout.
   - **path**: Path to the directory where Moodle is installed.
   - **moodle**: Name of the Moodle folder within the specified path.
   - **chown_user**: Specifies the user to set as the owner for Moodle files and directories, useful for setting file ownership after cloning or updating Moodle (e.g., www-data).
   - **chown_group**: Specifies the group to set as the owner for Moodle files and directories, ensuring correct group ownership and permissions (e.g., www-data).
   - **folder_backup_path**: Custom directory where backup files will be stored. If left blank, the current working directory will be used.
   - **db_dump_path**: Custom directory where DB dumps will be stored. If left blank, the current working directory will be used.
   - **read_db_from_config** Read database name, username and password from `config.php`, default is True
   - **db_name**: Name of the Moodle database, ignored if read_db_from_config is True.
   - **db_user**: Database username used for DB dump, ignored if read_db_from_config is True.
   - **`log_to_console`**: Enable or disable logging to the console.
   - **`log_to_file`**: Enable or disable logging to a file.
   - **`log_file_path`**: Specify the file path where logs should be saved (only if `log_to_file` is enabled).
   - **`log_level`**: Define the level of detail for logging. Available levels:  
      - `DEBUG`: Detailed information for debugging.  
      - `INFO`: General informational messages (default).  
      - `WARNING`: Indicates potential issues.  
      - `ERROR`: Errors that need immediate attention.  
      - `CRITICAL`: Severe errors causing program termination.  

   `config.ini` will be created on startup if not existing.
   Edit `config.ini` to match your Moodle setup:
   ```ini
   [settings]
   dry_run = False
   auto_update_script = True
   repo = https://github.com/BLC-FHGR/moodle
   branch = MOODLE_500_STABLE
   path = /var/www/moodle
   moodle = moodle
   chown_user = www-data
   chown_group = www-data
   folder_backup_path = /var/www/moodle
   db_dump_path = /var/www/moodle/db_dump
   [database]
   read_db_from_config = True
   db_name = moodle
   db_user = root
   [logging]
   log_to_console = True
   log_to_file = True
   log_file_path = moodle_updater.log
   log_level = INFO
   ```

4. Make the script executable (optional):
   ```bash
   chmod +x moodle_updater.py
   ```

## Usage

Run the script from the terminal:
```bash
python3 moodle_updater.py
```

### Example Workflow

1. **Directory Backup**:
   - Choose to back up the entire Moodle directory or specific components.
   - Backups are stored with timestamps in a folder defined in `config.ini` for easy identification.

2. **Database Backup**:
   - Dump the Moodle database to a `.sql` file in the directory specified in `config.ini`.
   - Database credentials are read from the `config.php` file if `read_db_from_config` is enabled in `config.ini`. Otherwise, credentials specified in `config.ini` are used, password is requested by the user.
   - Before dumping, the script asks if the database should be restarted.
   - If restarted, a **2-second pause** is added to ensure the database is fully initialized before proceeding.

3. **Git Operations**:
   - Clone the Moodle repository.
   - Optionally restore `config.php` from a previous backup.
   - Ensures the local repository is up-to-date before operations if there are no local changes.

4. **Multithreading**:
   - Directory backups, database dumps, and Git operations can run concurrently, saving time.

5. **Moodle CLI Upgrade**:
   - After updating Moodle, you can run the Moodle upgrade script (`admin/cli/upgrade.php`) automatically.
   - The script asks for confirmation before proceeding.
   - You will be asked whether to enable Maintenance Mode before upgrading.
   - If enabled, Maintenance Mode will be automatically disabled once the upgrade is complete.
   - Any errors encountered during the CLI upgrade are logged.
   - If the web server was stopped for the update, it will be restarted after the upgrade.

6. **Post-Process**:
   - Optionally restart Apache or Nginx to apply changes.

### Key Prompts

- **Path**: Confirm the default Moodle installation path or provide a custom path.
- **Database Credentials**: Enter the Moodle database name, user, and password when prompted.
- **Git Repository**: By default, clones the Moodle repository from GitHub with the branch `MOODLE_500_STABLE`.

### Logs and Outputs

- Backups and dumps are timestamped for easy tracking.
- All errors are reported to the terminal, including failed database connections or file operations.

## Multithreading Efficiency

The script optimizes runtime by leveraging Python's threading module. Tasks like backups and Git operations run in parallel, significantly reducing execution time.
